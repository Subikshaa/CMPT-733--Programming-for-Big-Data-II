1) Since the class label of the dataset is not known, certain unsupervised learning techniques like clustering, semi-unsupervised learning, manual labelling or crowdsourcing can be used in order to label two classes. The training dataset can be split into 65% and 35% for training and testing data. If there are many data with the same class label, the model will have more misclassifications. Therefore, the training dataset should be constructed in such a way that there should be same number of data in both classes.

2) Inorder to transform a pair of records into a feature vector, we can find various similarity and dissimilarity scores between the strings of two records. The techniques include finding cosine similairty, jaccard simlarity between two strings, using python libraries like wordnet, word2vec etc. These scores can be generated and normalized and a feature vector can be created.

3) Test dataset can be created by splitting the training dataset into 65% for training and 35% for testing. The splitting should be made in such a way that the number of records in each class of training dataset are not skewed. Records of each class should be taken individually and splitting should be made on those records so that the class balance is maintained.
